# CNSS-Bot
Instead of browsing the CNSS site to find the answer to your question, it will be possible to ask it directly to our chatbot and get your answer directly.

For this purpose, we tried in this project to design a CNSSBot chatbot using
Chatterbot Library to create the chatbot as well as Flask Framework to visualize the
chatbot on web, and MongoDB to record the give and the conversation between
the user and the bot. This chat tool can dialogue with a user and understand
their requests in natural language, to offer answers or references,
through initial learning and continuous practice. This process is done simply by analyzing the phrase entered by the user, then searching
automatically in the knowledge base and in the end return the best answer found![c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57497464/154808041-30c67242-d833-4744-82b2-91e9e281963a.PNG)
